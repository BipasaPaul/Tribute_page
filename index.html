        <h3><u>Birth</u></h3>
        <p><span> (12 January 1863 – 4 July 1902)</span>, Narendranath Datta, was an Indian Hindu monk, philosopher, author, religious teacher, and the chief disciple of the Indian mystic Ramakrishna. He was a key figure in the introduction of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world, and the father of modern Indian nationalism who is credited with raising interfaith awareness and bringing Hinduism to the status of a major world religion.<i> <a href="birth.html">Click Here To know more about his birth</a></i></p>

        <p>After Ramakrishna's death, his devotees and admirers stopped supporting his disciples. Unpaid rent accumulated, and Narendra and the other disciples had to find a new place to live. Many returned home, adopting a Grihastha <span>(family-oriented)</span> way of life.Narendra decided to convert a dilapidated house at Baranagar into a new math <span>(monastery)</span> for the remaining disciples. Rent for the Baranagar Math was low, raised by "holy begging" <span>(mādhukarī)</span>. The math became the first building of the Ramakrishna Math: the monastery of the monastic order of Ramakrishna.Narendra and other disciples used to spend many hours in practising meditation and religious austerities every day. Narendra later reminisced about the early days of the monastery</p>
        <h3><u>Meeting Ramakrishna</u></h3>
        <p><span> 1881</span>, Narendra first met Ramakrishna, who became his spiritual focus after his own father had died in <span></span>1884</span>.

          <p> Narendra's first introduction to Ramakrishna occurred in a literature class at General Assembly's Institution when he heard Professor William Hastie lecturing on William Wordsworth's poem, The Excursion. While explaining the word "trance" in the poem, Hastie suggested that his students visit Ramakrishna of Dakshineswar to understand the true meaning of trance. This prompted some of his students (including Narendra) to visit Ramakrishna</p> 
            
           <p> They probably first met personally in<span>November 1881</span>, though Narendra did not consider this their first meeting, and neither man mentioned this meeting later. At this time, Narendra was preparing for his upcoming F. A. examination, when Ram Chandra Datta accompanied him to Surendra Nath Mitra's, house where Ramakrishna was invited to deliver a lecture.According to Makarand Paranjape, at this meeting Ramakrishna asked young Narendra to sing. Impressed by his singing talent, he asked Narendra to come to Dakshineshwar</p>
